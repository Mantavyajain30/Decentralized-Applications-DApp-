# Decentralized-Applications-DApp-
DApps opens up the features and services of the blockchain to the whole world for review, interaction and enjoyment. DApp gives access to people, applications and systems, not necessarily known to each other to transact peer to peer. DApp is an end to end application on a blockchain. As DApp combines client or the front – end then it can be a web page, HTML and JavaScript framework, command line interface (CLI), a desktop application, a mobile application, or even an IoT (Internet of Things.)

IPFS - We will be using IPFS (Interplanetary file system) which is an non-block chain back-end. IPFS is a decentralized system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications and data. IPFS is a distributed file sharing system which can help in sharing large files and store in much efficient way.

For showing the working of DApp, I have implemented - 
Decentralized cloud Storage System - where data is stored on multiple computers or servers and these servers are hosted by the people or companies which are taking part in this decentralized cloud.
